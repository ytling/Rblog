<p>11点左右我起来练了一会儿瑜伽，大概半个小时，我和自己讲，每天早上都要练习一下。 练完，大概想一下穿的衣服，出门去教会了。</p>
<p>参加完唱歌，我听了一位朋友在分享他的洗礼的经历，然后gary 牧师在受教。 我记得其中一个很有趣的栗子：</p>
<p>“I had a very bad experience during a lunch that the server is so rude and careless. I was angry but my daugher guide me: Dad, we should give more tip for her. Me: why? daugher: Because she may not own as much as we though. A little more may help her change better. The little mean nothing to us.”</p>
<p>我非常非常受到感动， 主要是因为，一个孩子说的话，如此的善良和智慧。</p>
