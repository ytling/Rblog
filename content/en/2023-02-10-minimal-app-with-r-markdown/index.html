<p>some feedback from yihuiâ€™s talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiy32LjgGUE">youtube</a>.</p>
<p>I tried the code he present on the video. I can see it did minimized the file size without affecting the feeling of the web browsers.</p>
<p>One important change is to use the <code>output: html_format</code> to replace the <code>output: html_document</code> on the YAML metadata. This has been built into a GUI if you used the R studio by creating a new rmarkdown specifying the html output.</p>
<p>One part that interests me the most is to turn the html r markdown output into a slide by using the css.</p>
<p>The example code can be below:</p>
<pre class="css"><code>
.html {
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}

.slide  {
    min-height: 100vh;
    scroll-snap-align: start;
}</code></pre>
<style type="text/css">

.html {
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}

.slide  {
    min-height: 100vh;
    scroll-snap-align: start;
}
</style>
<p>The above code is to identify what is <strong>slide</strong> mean for every time it is called. Please note to set the <code>echo</code> to <strong>FALSE</strong>.</p>
<p>After copying this code into the R markdown file, you will need <code>&lt;div class = "slide"&gt;</code> at the beginning of the section of the document and <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> at the end of the section.</p>
